## Game Rules
1\. The game starts with Player X placing his symbol wherever he wants.

2\. Now Player O has to place his symbol in the marked subboard corresponding to the field taken by Player X.

3\. When a player places 3 of his symbols in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally - just like in the standart Tic Tac Toe Game) he wins the entire subboard.

4\. When a player has to place his symbol in the board which is already won (or there is a tie) he can choose one of the remaining fields in all subboards.
